# PHP-Laravel-CRUD-Application
I developed a PHP Laravel CRUD application. I used bootstrap for frontend because, i didn't focus much on frontend. There is a Controller which has all the functions to store, view, update and delete the data. The data is stored in mySql database. If you want to use the project, just configure the ".env" file and you are good to go.
